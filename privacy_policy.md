# Hikari Privacy Policy

Last Updated: March 10, 2025

Hikari is a Chrome extension developed to assist users in learning and exploring the Japanese language by reading selected Japanese text aloud from webpages in a realistic, real-time Japanese voice. This Privacy Policy explains how Hikari handles your data and ensures transparency in its operations.

## Data Collection and Usage
Hikari does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users beyond what is strictly necessary for its functionality. Specifically:

- **Selected Text**: When you select Japanese text on a webpage and use Hikari, the extension processes only the selected text to generate audio output via a text-to-speech service. This text is not stored or logged by Hikari after the audio is produced.
- **No Personal Data**: Hikari does not access, collect, or store personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, email, browsing history, or IP address).
- **Third-Party Services**: Hikari may use a secure, third-party text-to-speech service (e.g., [insert specific service if applicable, like Google Text-to-Speech]) to convert selected text into audio. Only the selected text is sent to this service, and it is not retained or linked to any user identity.

## Permissions
Hikari requires the following permissions to function:
- **`activeTab`**: To access the content of the active webpage and process selected text.
- **Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: To work on any webpage containing Japanese text.
- **[Add others if applicable, e.g., `scripting` for content scripts]**: To detect and process text selections.

These permissions are used solely to provide the text-to-speech feature and do not involve tracking or data collection beyond this purpose.

## Data Security
Any data processed by Hikari (i.e., selected text) is handled securely:
- Communication with third-party text-to-speech services is encrypted.
- No data is stored locally or remotely after the audio is generated.

## User Control
You have full control over when Hikari operates. The extension only activates when you select text and trigger its functionality.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Hikari’s functionality or legal requirements. The latest version will always be available at [https://github.com/daniyebra/hikari] .
